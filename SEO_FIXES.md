# SEO Fixes Applied to ThinkScope

## Issues Fixed

### ✅ 1. H1 Tag Missing
**Problem:** Homepage had no H1 tag  
**Solution:** Added prominent H1 tag to Hero component
- **File:** `components/Hero.tsx`
- **H1 Text:** "ThinkScope - Latest News & Updates"
- **Location:** Center of hero section with descriptive subtitle

### ✅ 2. Missing /cookies Page (404 Error)
**Problem:** Link to `/cookies` was returning 404  
**Solution:** Created comprehensive Cookie Policy page
- **File:** `app/cookies/page.tsx`
- **Content:** Detailed cookie policy covering:
  - What cookies are and how we use them
  - Types of cookies (Essential, Analytics, Advertising, Functional)
  - Third-party cookies (Google Analytics, AdSense)
  - Cookie management instructions
  - Opt-out options
  - Contact information

### ✅ 3. WWW and Non-WWW Working Separately
**Problem:** `www.thinkscope.in` and `thinkscope.in` treated as different sites  
**Solution:** Added permanent redirect from WWW to non-WWW
- **File:** `next.config.js`
- **Redirect:** `www.thinkscope.in/*` → `https://thinkscope.in/*`
- **Type:** 301 Permanent Redirect

### ✅ 4. Index.html and .php Redirects Not Configured
**Problem:** `/index.html` and `/index.php` not redirecting to root  
**Solution:** Added comprehensive redirects for legacy URLs
- **File:** `next.config.js`
- **Redirects Added:**
  - `/index.html` → `/`
  - `/index.php` → `/`
  - `/:path*.html` → `/:path*` (all HTML extensions)
  - `/:path*.php` → `/:path*` (all PHP extensions)
- **Type:** 301 Permanent Redirects

### ✅ 5. Text-to-Code Ratio Too Low (4%)
**Problem:** Text-to-code ratio was 4% (recommended >10%)  
**Solution:** Added substantial SEO-friendly text content to homepage
- **File:** `app/page.tsx`
- **Sections Added:**
  1. **"Your Trusted Source for Breaking News"** - Explains ThinkScope's mission and coverage
  2. **"Wide Range of News Categories"** - Lists all categories with descriptions
