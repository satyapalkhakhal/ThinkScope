## ‚ùå Critical Items Still Needed

### 1. **Content Completion** (HIGHEST PRIORITY)
You need to add full original content to the **remaining 23 articles** in `/data/categories.ts`.

Each article MUST have:
- **800-1500 words** of original, valuable content
- **Proper markdown formatting** with headings (##, ###)
- **Author name** and **author title**
- **Realistic, staggered dates** (spread over 3-6 months)
- **Topic-specific content** (not generic templates)

Current status:
- ‚úÖ 1/24 articles completed
- ‚ùå 23/24 articles still need full content

### 2. **Article Dates Must Be Staggered**
Currently, most articles show `2025-01-24`. This appears automated and will hurt your AdSense application.

**Required:**
- Spread article dates over 3-6 months
- Show consistent publishing schedule
- Example pattern:
  - Week 1: 2-3 articles
  - Week 2: 1-2 articles  
  - Week 3: 2-3 articles
  - Continue this pattern

### 3. **Content Quality Requirements**

For each article, write content that:

#### ‚úÖ GOOD Content (AdSense Approved):
- Original research and analysis
- Expert insights and professional commentary
- Real examples, case studies, or data
- Practical advice and actionable information
- Proper structure with introduction, body, conclusion
- Industry-specific terminology and depth
- Citations or references to credible sources

#### ‚ùå BAD Content (AdSense Rejected):
- Generic templates ("In today's digital landscape...")
- Spinning or rewording existing content
- AI-generated content without editing/personalization
- Thin content (less than 500 words)
- Keyword stuffing
- Duplicate content across articles
- Clickbait headlines without substance
